# Georgia Tech's CS 2110 - Computer Organization and Programming (Fall 2021)
## Course Description
An introduction to basic computer hardware, machine language, assembly language, and C programming. 
## Course Purpose
1) To understand the structure and operation of a modern computer from the ground up.
2) Understand basic hardware concepts: digital circuits, gates, bits, bytes, number representation
3) Understand the Von Neumann model and the structure and operation of a basic data path
4) Understand the structure and function of machine language instructions
5) Understand the structure and function of a symbolic assembly language
6) Understand basic concepts of computer systems such as the runtime stack, simple I/O devices
7) Introduce the C language with particular emphasis on the underlying assembly and machine
language as well as interaction with hardware.
## Course Outcomes
- (Competency Knowledge) Be able to identify and/or construct basic digital structures such as MOS FET logic gates, decoders, multiplexors, adders, memory.
- (Competency Application) Be able to construct a state machine diagram and then implement it as a finite state machine circuit.
- (Competency Comprehension) Understand data representation. Be able to convert numbers between various representations: Binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal, and IEEE Floating Point.
- (Competency Knowledge) Be able to identify the component parts of the Von Neumann Model of computer and be able to explain the purpose of each component.
- (Competency Synthesis) Be able to write, debug and run assembly language programs including recursive subroutines, traps, basic input/output.
- (Accomplishment Synthesis) Be able to write, debug and run multi-file C programs several hundred lines long using "make" to compile and execute said programs.
- (Competency Synthesis) Be able to utilize (in C programs) proper typing and casting constructs, structs, pointers and arrays, functions, function pointers, dynamic memory allocation and variables of different storage classes (auto, static, volatile, etc.)
