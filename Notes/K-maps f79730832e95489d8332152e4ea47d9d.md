# Questions and Answers

### K-map setup

### What should be the dimensions of a 3-variable K-map? A 4-variable K-map?

- 3 var - 2 x 4
- 4 var - 4 x 4

### What is Gray code?

- ordering of the binary numeral system such that two successive values differ in only one bit

### Given the variables A and B, classify the following K-map labels as valid or invalid Gray code:

- A'B, A'B', AB', AB valid
- A’B’, A’B, AB’, AB invalid
- AB’, A’B’, A’B, AB valid
- AB, AB’, A’B, A’B’ invalid
- AB, AB’, A’B’, A’B valid
- A'B', AB, A'B, AB' invalid
- A'B, AB, AB', AB valid
- A'B', A'B, AB, AB' valid
- Practice translating truth tables into K-maps

### K-map groupings

### What are the restrictions on K-map groupings?

- Groups must be rectangular (but they may wrap around edges!)
- Groups may only contain “1s” or “Xs”
- All “1s” must be contained within at least one group
- Groups must be as large as possible
- The size of a group must be a power of 2 - note that you may have a group of size 1

### What do you do with don’t-care values when making your K-map groupings?

- mark spots with Xs, and can use them if needed
- can use as either a 1 or 0 or ignore entirely
- Practice 3-variable and 4-variable K-map groupings
- Practice converting groupings into a sum-of-products expression
- We've put together a spreadsheet of 4-variable K-map grouping for practice. You can find the spreadsheet [here](https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/swahi3_gatech_edu/EYO-au5ay2xAqsXq4lTJOFYBnIdVxyXmNH6dZTosc4DbHg?e=hdENwp).
    - The cells filled with black contain the solutions to the minimal groupings as sum-of-products expressions. To view a solution, click on the filled-in cell; you'll be able to see the contents of the cell in the formula bar above.
