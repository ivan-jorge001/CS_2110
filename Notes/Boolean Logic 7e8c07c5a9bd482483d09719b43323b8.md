# Truth Table to Circuit

An AND gate for every line in the truth table (i.e. build a decoder) connected to the inputs

An OR gate connecting the AND gates for the lines that have 1 in their output column

# Circuit to Boolean Expression/Truth Table

- If it is a Sum Of Product Circuit
    - Each AND gate generates a term with the input conditions that yield a 1 from the AND gate (times)
    - All of the terms are ORed together (plus)
- Circuit to Truth table
    - Each AND gate represents one row of your truth table (inputs)
    - Each OR gate represents one output column of your truth table
    - All of the inputs that produce a 1 output are tied to that OR gate
