Addition with unsigned or 2's complement binary numbers

Subtraction with 2's complement binary numbers

## Overflow

Extra digits that does NOT fit into the available bits.

Overflow occurs if:

- We get a carry in to sign bit but no carry out
- We get a carry out of the sign bit but no carry in

Overflow never occurs if we add a positive number with a negative number.

## Sign Extension

- Suppose we have a number which is stored in a four bit register
- We wish to add this number to a number stored in an eight bit register
- We have a device which will do the addition and it is designed to add two 8 bit numbers
- What issues do we need to deal with?
- To add bits to the left of a twoâ€™s complement number (i.e. make the number of bits bigger while representing the same numeric value)...
    - Fill the new bits on the left with the value of the sign bit!

## Adding a number to itself

$A+A=2\times A=A << 1$
